# Chest_Disease_Classification

we've developed a cutting-edge solution to classify chest X-ray images, helping medical professionals quickly identify patients suffering from adenocarcinoma and distinguish them from normal cases. Leveraging the powerful VGG16 model, we've fine-tuned it on our custom dataset of chest CT scan images for optimal accuracy.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack:

- TensorFlow Framework: For building and training our deep learning model.
- Python: The core programming language that powered our project.
- MLflow: This was invaluable for tracking experiments, comparing different models, and hyperparameter tuning, ensuring we always had the best performing model.
- DVC (Data Version Control): Our go-to MLOps tool for efficient pipeline tracking. It was crucial for maintaining our project's integrity over time.
- Google Drive: Our choice for data ingestion, facilitating seamless access to our dataset for training and validation.
- Flask: Used to develop the web application interface for interacting with our model, making it accessible to users and researchers.
